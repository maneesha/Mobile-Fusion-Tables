Philadelphia Farmers Markets
====================

This is a mobile-ready website using Fusion Tables and jQuery Mobile, based on [Fusion Table Searchable Map Template](https://github.com/derekeder/FusionTable-Map-Template) and [Mobile Fusion Tables](https://github.com/sfbrigade/Mobile-Fusion-Tables).

The website allows users to find Philadelphia area farmers' markets based on schedule and participating vendors.  Finding markets by location is a bit buggy -- I'm working on that.

All markets are visible on the map when you load the page.  Large icons show markets that are currently running; small dots represent markets closed for the season.  Click on 'search' to display only markets meeting your criteria on the map.  Click on 'list' to see those same markets in list view.  Click on 'about' to learn more about how I made the map and how to contribute data.
